### Michael Zingale

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on algorithms for modeling reactive
  astrophysics flows, applying these to studies of X-ray bursts,
  Type Ia supernovae, stellar convection, and novae.

- My main work is on the suite of
  [AMReX-Astrophysics](https://github.com/amrex-astro/) codes Castro
  (for compressible flows) and MAESTROeX (for low Mach number
  stratified flows).  These are designed to run on supercomputers
  (using CPUs or GPUs) and model reacting astrophysical flows.
