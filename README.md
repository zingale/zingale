### Michael Zingale

- Iâ€™m currently working on algorithms for modeling reactive
  astrophysics flows, applying these to studies of X-ray bursts,
  Type Ia supernovae, stellar convection, and novae.

- My main work is on the suite of
  [AMReX-Astrophysics](https://github.com/amrex-astro/) codes:
  [Castro](https://github.com/amrex-astro/Castro/) (for compressible
  flows) and [MAESTROeX](https://github.com/amrex-astro/MAESTROeX)
  (for low Mach number stratified flows).  These are designed to run
  on supercomputers (using CPUs or GPUs) and model reacting
  astrophysical flows.

- I am also very interested in making teaching resources (especially
  for computational astrophysics) freely available, including:

  * My open text [Introduction to Computational Astrophysical Hydrodynamics](https://github.com/Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf/numerical_exercises) introduces the core finite-volume methods
    used in astrophysics simulation codes.

  * The teaching and protyping code [pyro](https://github.com/python-hydro/pyro2).

  * My introductory [astronomy animations](https://github.com/zingale/astro_animations).
